      <description>Hey everyone!
The Oracle database includes a built-in scheduler that allows scheduling functions and procedures that can be called from any PL/SQL program. The DBMS_SCHEDULER package introduced in Oracle 10g helps to create, run and monitor jobs. In addition, one can also define a job to execute a batch (.bat) file. In order to run an external job, you need to enable and start the OracleJobScheduler service on the database server.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
Starting from Oracle version 10g, a new feature known as RecycleBin was introduced to recover dropped tables. Dropped tables go &#34;into&#34; the recyclebin, and can be restored (undropped) from the recyclebin.
By default the RECYCLEBIN option is ON. Hence you can recover the tables dropped, by using the FLASHBACK table command as follows!
Pre-requisites: Oracle database 10g Express Edition with *SQLPlus Open *SQLPlus and run the following commands! DROP TABLE YOURTABLENAME; FLASHBACK TABLE YOURTABLENAME TO BEFORE DROP; Check parameter RECYCLEBIN using the below command</description>
