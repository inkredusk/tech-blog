      <description>Hello everyone!
Imagine a tool that regularly stop certain build processes in an existing CI/CD pipeline in order to ensure that the underlying infrastructure is indeed fault resilient.
Chaos engineering has been in the news for quite some time now and it is important for software engineers to determine the resiliency of the system.
