      <description>Hey everyone!
Working on Kivy has been an amazing learning experience. Kivy has made user interface development a lot easier. Today, I will talk about Accordion, one of the interesting widgets that Kivy has to offer to developers out there.

Accordion is basically a Widget in the form of a menu where in the options are stacked either horizontally or vertically. An Accordion will contain one or many AccordionItem instances such that each item when touched opens up displaying it&#39;s underlying content.</description>
