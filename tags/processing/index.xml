      <description>Hello everyone!
The Processing language has now become a popular development tool for Android applications. It&#39;s latest version 2.0+ allows developers to create an Android application from scratch using the newly added Android mode.
Processing supports many libraries including video, network, PDF export etc. Just as Android, Processing is also open source and can be downloaded for free. Through this post, I will demonstrate how to create an Android application using Processing!</description>
