      <description>Hey everyone!
I recently started using Svelte and it&#39;s quite amazing. The good part about Svelte is that it is a compiler and has no additional framework dependencies. The only dependencies are the devDependencies, that&#39;s it. Hence, the result is a light-weight performant app with a significantly smaller bundle size (thanks to those rollup plugins). Moreover, Svelte ensures that everything happens during the compile or the build time rather than on the browser at runtime.</description>
