Qt is a cross-platform application framework used extensively for developing non-GUI programs and consoles for servers. It is written in C++ and works on major platforms including Android, iOS, Windows and more recently Sailfish MeeGo Linux.

Full Framework – complete commercial edition Open Source – complete Open Source edition</description>
