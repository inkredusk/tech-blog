      <description>Hey everyone!
Android provides the PackageInfo class that contains information about the contents of a package. Sometimes, we need to obtain the list of applications installed on an Android device in order to determine whether our application was installed correctly or not. In this post, I will demonstrate how to obtain the list of all installed applications on your Android device. Since I would be obtaining information about an application, I would also be using the ApplicationInfo class.</description>
