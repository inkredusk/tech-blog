      <description>Hey everyone!
As developers, we often need to create applications that can share data with other applications residing on the Android device. A content provider is similar to a database where one can query it, edit its content, as well as add or delete content using insert, update, delete, and query methods. As mentioned on the developer&#39;s page, Content providers manage access to a structured set of data. They encapsulate the data, and provide mechanisms for defining data security.</description>
