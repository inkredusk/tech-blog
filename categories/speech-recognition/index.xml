Speech recognition has always being one of those features that is always perceived to be good based on it&amp;rsquo;s acccuracy. There exists a ton of libraries today that offer this functionality in almost any kind of app.
I happened to stumble upon Annyang a few weeks back and wanted to try it in an existing PWA (Progressive Web App).</description>
